I made Conway's game of life in c++ ( running on terminal )

This code is not very good as i have little experience with c++ 
but its functional if all parameters are valid 

note : also if you are using a linux change system("cls") to system("clear") or else it wont work !

Example of how the code show look in the terminal :

eventually some cells should build their own "bases" and stabilize and others might stabilize but keep moving like those spinning 3 cells like this :
